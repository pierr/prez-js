# Promise
--
## Callback problem
- Answer to the callback problem which are difficult to manage when the workflow is complex.
- If an **exception** occurs, the **thread** is **broken**.
- A callback must be **register before** its **called**.
- A callback can be trigger **multiple** times. 
--

## State
- **Pending**: don't get a result.
- **Fullfilled**: unable to get a result.
- **Rejected**: a problem occurs.
- **Setteled**: fullfilled  or rejected
--

## How it works
- Must be followed by a `then(onFullFilled, [,onRejected])`
- Each argument is optional and must be a function
- Only one will be called, **once**
- The call is **asynchronous**
--
## The code
```:javascript
var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  //Do something maybe asynchronous or not
  var isOk = treatement();
  if (isOk) {
    resolve("It works...");
  } else {
    reject(Error("It does not work!"));
  }
```
